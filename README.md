Simple screensaver with moving stars.

Press the space bar to open/close the settings.
When you press the "Generate" button, 200 stars will appear, or
you can set your number yourself.
The highest number of stars depends on the processor, my laptop starts to feel bad at 5 thousand.
You can also choose the color of the stars and background

For more immersion, you can press f11
